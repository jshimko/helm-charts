# PostgresCluster

This chart is used to deploy a `PostgresCluster` instance using [Crunchy Postgres Operator](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest).

This chart is just a copy of their example chart. It is only copied here so that it is available in our Helm repository (the official chart is not published anywhere and requires a git clone).
